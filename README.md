# ELI-Bio
A not-so-elegant attempt at genetic algorithms. Not very good, as it doesn't really allow for complex patterns to arise. Will fix this by requiring mating, by averaging the two parents' hidden layers, and just let them survive and reproduce rather than reset all the children and start over with every generation. Might introduce food to encourage a more complex creature to come about.
